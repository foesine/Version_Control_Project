## Introduction
Rebasing and cherry-picking come to use when the work has diverged and branches were created. They are tools used by repository maintainers instead of merging branches from other contributers. The main advantage it has to the classical merge is the ability to maintain a mostly linear history.

Cherry-picking while interesting feature is an option that needs to find a proper place to be used. There are few possible uses for this command such as for exemple work in teams where tight collaboration is in place. Cherry-picking enables workers to pick a selected commit and proceed with only certain changes. 
Other possible use for cherry-picking is when bug needs to be fixed. This command makes the process of the fixes easier in a way, that the new commit can be cherry-picked right onto main branch, before more damage is done.
Last but not least undoing certain changes or restoring lost commits can be provided by the use of cherry-picking. Using other git comands and the knowledge that git stores these data still we can revive
