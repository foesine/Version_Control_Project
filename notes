Cherry-pick 

- linear history 
- to introduce work from one branch to another 
- rebase for a single commit 
- it takes the patch that was introduced in a commit and tries to reapply it on the branch you're currently on 
- useful if you have a number of commits on a topic branch and you want to integrate only one of them, or if you only have one commit on a topic branch and you'd prefer to cherry-pick it rather than run rebase
